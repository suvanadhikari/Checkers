# Checkers
This is a checkers game I created, utilizing the following skills:
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Trees
- Artificial Intelligence

The game is coded in Processing (Java) and features a full-feature checkers game with 4 types of players:
- Human: Self explanatory, a human plays the game, clicking on a piece, clicking on its destination, and pressing enter
- Randomized: A bot that plays a random legal move.
- Calculated winner: A bot that looks 3 full moves ahead for forced winning moves, and plays the best move.
- Calculated loser: Similar to Calculated winner, but plays the worst move.

More details on the game and its implementation, including a video, are included in the info folder.
